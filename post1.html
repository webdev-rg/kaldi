          We’re proud to announce that we’ll be offering a small batch of
          Jamaica Blue Mountain coffee beans in our store next week.
        </p>
        <p>
          We expect the shipment of a limited quantity of green beans next
          Monday. We’ll be offering the roasted beans from Tuesday, but
          quantities are limited, so be quick.

          Blue Mountain Peak is the highest mountain in Jamaica and one of the
          highest peaks in the Caribbean at 7,402 ft. It is the home of Blue
          Mountain coffee and their famous tours. It is located on the border of
          the Portland and Saint Thomas parishes of Jamaica.
        </p>

        <h2>A little history</h2>

        <p>
          The Blue Mountains are considered by many to be a hiker’s and camper’s
          paradise. The traditional Blue Mountain trek is a 7-mile hike to the
          peak and consists of a 3,000-foot increase in elevation. Jamaicans
          prefer to reach the peak at sunrise, thus the 3–4 hour hike is usually
          undertaken in darkness. Since the sky is usually very clear in the
          mornings, Cuba can be seen in the distance.
        </p>

        <div class="row">
          <p>
            Some of the plants found on the Blue Mountain cannot be found
            anywhere else in the world and they are often of a dwarfed sort.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          This is mainly due to the cold climate which inhibits growth. The
          small coffee farming communities of Claverty Cottage and Hagley Gap
          are located near the peak.
        </p>

        <h2>What you need to know before trying</h2>

        <p>
          Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee or Jamaica Blue Mountain Coffee is a
          classification of coffee grown in the Blue Mountains of Jamaica. The
          best lots of Blue Mountain coffee are noted for their mild flavor and
          lack of bitterness. Over the past few decades, this coffee has
          developed a reputation that has made it one of the most expensive and
          sought-after coffees in the world. Over 80% of all Jamaican Blue
          Mountain Coffee is exported to Japan. In addition to its use for
          brewed coffee, the beans are the flavor base of Tia Maria coffee
          liqueur.
        </p>

        <p>
          Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee is a globally protected certification
          mark, meaning only coffee certified by the Coffee Industry Board of
          Jamaica can be labeled as such. It comes from a recognized growing
          region in the Blue Mountain region of Jamaica, and its cultivation is
          monitored by the Coffee Industry Board of Jamaica.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Blue Mountains are generally located between Kingston to the south
          and Port Antonio to the north. Rising 7,402 ft, they are some of the
          highest mountains in the Caribbean. The climate of the region is cool
          and misty with high rainfall. The soil is rich, with excellent
          drainage. This combination of climate and soil is considered ideal for
          coffee.
